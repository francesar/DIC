# üçù  Do it Carefully (DIC) üçù 
**Do it Carefully** is a programming languange that aims to provide developers with native support for matrix operations, while still following the object oriented mumbo jumbo that we all know and love. 

## Usage
In order to build the **DIC** compiler, run `make build`. Running `make build` uses `ocamlbuild` to generate a `toplevel.native` file, which serves as the driver for the **DIC**. Once built, you can pass a `.dic` file to be read by the compiler. 

## Progress
Currently, all currently agreed upon syntax has been implemented. We do however have small bug in the variable declaration list inside of our functions. All `vdecl`'s (variable declarations) must happen before any `stmt` (statement) blocks. A bugfix is coming soon üôä.

## Running the tests
Tests are defined in the `tests/` directory. In order to run the tests, make sure to have `ocamlbuild` installed on your machine, and run `make clean` (in the case that **DIC** has been built before) followed by `make test` in order to run the test suite. Currently there are 10 tests total, 5 positive tests that show showcase possible valid programs written in **DIC**, and 5 negative tests that show invalid programs that are expected to through syntax errors. The output's format prints the contents of the test file to STDOUT and either returns Ocaml's `Fatal error: exception Parsing.Parse_error` in the case that the test file is expected to through an error or nothing if the test ran sucessfully.
